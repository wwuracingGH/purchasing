# Purchasing

## Who is WWU Racing?

WWU Racing is a club at Western Washington University that designs, manufactures, tests, and races a single–seater, formula style racecar every year. We compete in the Formula SAE California competition (formerly held in Lincoln, NE), along with over a hundred other universities from around the world. There are similar competitions all over the globe—Michigan, Canada, Brazil, the UK, Germany, Japan, and more.

## The new purchasing system

At WWU Racing, a purchase order is made by a team member, and the system lead and the directors look at it and sign it. Twice a week, someone goes through the signed purchase orders and orders them in the main office of the engineering building. From there, the purchases get put into the Master Budget, where the whole team can look at the purchases that have been made. This results in four main sections of the purchasing system:

* Creating and saving a purchase order, or PO
* Reviewing and signing the PO by system leads, directors
* Buying the products listed in the PO
* Storing and viewing past and current POs (the Master Budget)

We've decided to create a new purchasing system to replace the old system, which was bodged together between a few separate programs. The new system uses Node.js and Express.js for the backend, JQuery for the frontend, and Pug as a template engine. Were I to start again from scratch, I'd probably use a more modern front end like React or Vue or something.
